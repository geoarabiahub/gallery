The BSE image shows compositional contrast and grain textures, while the QEMSCAN map identifies minerals: pink areas represent quartz, and lime-green areas show illite forming grain coatings along quartz surfaces. This highlights the distribution of illite coatings, which can affect reservoir quality and fluid interactions.",
